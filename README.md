# Weather-Data-Clustering-Using-k-means
In this notebook, I perform k-means clustering using scikit-learn in Python.  I will use cluster analysis to generate a big picture model of the weather at a local station using a minute-graunlarity data. 

In this dataset, I have in the order of millions records. I have used 12 clusters to represent them.

NOTE: The dataset that I will use is in a large CSV file called minute_weather.csv downloaded from: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8iiZ7pSaSFZb3ItQ1l4LWRMTjg
